### Hi Developers ðŸ‘‹

I'm an innovative Front-end Developer.
The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me. I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include front-end development using technologies (React, ReactJs, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Redux, Responsive, UX, Firebase), design (working closely with designers), Server Administrator( GCP), CI/CD(Docker, kubernetes)

Languages and Tools:
